# Reachability and distance in a simple directed graph

The directed analogue of `AlgoLib.Theory.Graph.Connectivity.Reachable`, together with the
*distance* — the least length of a walk between two vertices. The distance is the
specification that breadth-first search (`AlgoLib.Algorithms.Graph.Traversal.BFS`) is
proved to compute.

Because every simple graph has a symmetric orientation `SimpleGraph.toSimpleDiGraph` in
which walks are the same walks, the undirected distance is *defined* through the directed
one rather than duplicated; the transfer lemmas at the end of this file are what make
that definition usable.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleDiGraph.Reachable G u v` — some simple walk realized in `G` runs from `u` to `v`.
* `SimpleDiGraph.dist G u v` — the least length of such a walk, in `ℕ∞`; `⊤` when `v` is
  not reachable from `u`.
* `SimpleGraph.dist G u v` — the distance in the symmetric orientation.

## Main results

* `SimpleDiGraph.Reachable.refl`, `SimpleDiGraph.Reachable.trans` — reachability is a
  preorder on `V(G)`. There is no symmetry: this is the directed setting.
* `SimpleDiGraph.dist_le_length`, `SimpleDiGraph.le_dist_iff` — the infimum API.
* `SimpleDiGraph.dist_eq_top_iff`, `SimpleDiGraph.reachable_iff_dist_ne_top` — the
  distance is finite exactly on reachable pairs.
* `SimpleDiGraph.dist_exists` — a finite distance is attained by a walk.
* `SimpleGraph.reachable_toSimpleDiGraph_iff` — reachability in `G` is reachability in
  its symmetric orientation, and likewise `SimpleGraph.dist_comm` for the distance.

## Design choices

* **Walks, not paths, in the definitions**, for the same reason as in the undirected
  file: gluing two walks is a walk, while gluing two paths needs cycle erasure, hence
  `[DecidableEq α]` inside a `Prop`. A shortest walk is automatically a path, so nothing
  is lost.
* **Nested `⨅`, mirroring `girth` and `κ`.** `dist` has the shape
  `⨅ (w) (_ : P w), f w`, so the standard infimum API (`le_iInf₂_iff`, `iInf₂_le`,
  `iInf_eq_top`) applies verbatim, and `⊤` on unreachable pairs is the empty-index
  convention rather than a special case.
* **The undirected distance is the directed one.** `SimpleGraph.dist` unfolds to
  `SimpleDiGraph.dist` on `G.toSimpleDiGraph`: one definition, one algorithm, and one
  correctness proof serve both kinds of graph.

/-! ## The symmetric orientation

A simple walk is realized in `G` exactly when it is realized in the symmetric orientation
`G.toSimpleDiGraph`, because adjacency is the same relation. Reachability and distance
transfer accordingly, and the undirected distance is defined through the directed one. -/
